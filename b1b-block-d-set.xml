        <long-description>
            The Rockwell B-1 Lancer, commonly referred to as the "Bone" (derived from "B-One"), is a supersonic heavy
            bomber equipped with variable-sweep wings, and remains integral to the United States Air Force. Alongside
            the B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress, it constitutes one of three strategic bombers in the U.S. Air
            Force's current arsenal. Notably designed for adaptability, the B-1 excels in various roles, owing to its
            ability to alter its wing configuration during flight. This advanced aircraft plays a crucial role in the
            nation's defense strategy, offering exceptional speed, payload capacity, and versatility for a wide array of
            mission profiles.
